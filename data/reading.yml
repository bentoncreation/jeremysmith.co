  notes: |
    * Your software is going to be tested, if not by your tests, then by users.
    * Separate requirements from policy (policies change, so keep these in metadata or configuration)
    * Create a project glossary that everyone uses for consistency
    * Some things are better done than described
    * If you document requirements in a way that an end user can understand, then there's no one to verify they are correct, because they must be interpreted back to them.
    * Successful teams speak with a unified voice and have their own brand/identity
    * A team librarian indexes and stores code and documentation, and is the port of call when looking for things.
    * Suprise your users with just a little bit more than they were expecting.
