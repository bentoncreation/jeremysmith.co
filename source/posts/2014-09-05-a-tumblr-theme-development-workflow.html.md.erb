title: A Tumblr Theme Development Workflow

This site has been running on Tumblr for a while now and, while I love using Tumblr for posting content, I’ve found theme development to be frustrating and tedious, particularly with trying to manage asset files.

I’m used to single-command site deployment, so going back to copy-and-paste and manual file uploads is painful.

I thought there must be a better way, so I Googled around and came across [Tumblargh](https://github.com/jasonwebster/tumblargh), a Ruby gem that works on top of [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and simplifies theme development by parsing Tumblr themes and pulling in your own site’s content via Tumblr’s API.

Tumblargh makes it much easier to test a template before releasing it, but it’s still very tedious to update the HTML template and then re-upload all your stylesheet, javascript and image assets.

This is where I took a different route. Rather than rely on Tumblr to handle all my stylesheet, javascript and image assets, I decided it would be better if I just hosted those myself under a separate domain: assets.bentoncreation.com.

Using the [middleman-deploy](https://github.com/karlfreeman/middleman-deploy) gem, I am able to run a single-command deploy of my Tumblargh/Middleman site to assets.bentoncreation.com and then I only have to copy and paste the index.html from /build to my Tumblr HTML template.

Here’s my deploy config:

```
activate :deploy do |deploy|
  deploy.build_before = true
  deploy.method = :rsync
  deploy.user   = "deploy"
  deploy.host   = "myhost.com"
  deploy.path   = "/var/www/assets.bentoncreation"
  deploy.clean = true
end
```

I hit one snag with this strategy. My Middleman HTML template and stylesheets are referencing relative paths, rather than the assets.bentoncreation.com host. So I added an asset_host variable with my host to the build config and overrode the asset_path method to include the full URL of my asset_host:

```
set :asset_host, 'http://assets.bentoncreation.com'
helpers do
  def asset_path(kind, source)
    "#{asset_host}#{super}"
  end
end
```

Now, as I’m making site changes, I can simply run `bundle update middleman deploy` and then copy and paste the contents of /build/index.html to my Tumblr HTML template.
